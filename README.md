I'm a full stack TypeScript developer that's been working in the app develop industry for about 10 years at this point... I think. Maybe more.

I have been using TypeScript for... since like version 2... _Google's release date_... maybe 7 years.

I have been the director of BlinkOrb Ltd for just over a year now - we make apps and stuff, and are currently open to contracts.

## What is/are this talk/demos about?

These demos will show off some of the more complex/powerful parts of TypeScript.

We'll start of with some simple examples and then gradually ramp up the power until we get onto the ones that basically nobody will be able to follow completely.

If you're viewing this on GitHub after the talk, checkout the code in the `/src` directory.

## A legit quote from a famous person

![You underestimate the power of the TypeScript. If you will not fight the types, then you will meet yor bugs](/images/the-power-of-the-typescript.png)

Yes, it's a legit quote. That's [insert famous programmer] in the helmet.

I chose this quote because it actually covers 2 important points:

1. There are many people that probably don't really utilize all the powerful features that TypeScript provides.
2. Most people, when starting out with TypeScript, will get very annoyed with type errors and, not truly understanding how useful they are, will end up typing everything as "any" which will only cause them further struggles.

Avoid "any" at all costs. ðŸ˜‰
